## Overview
OverSite was our final cross pollination project at [Turing School of Software and Design](http://turing.io). The goal for this project was to build a full stack application from ideation to production in just 14 days. The emphasis was on creating a professional agile workflow with a combination of front-end and back-end developers.
The core mission of OverSite is to amalgamate civic information into one easy to use application that allows the user to easily find Senator and Representative contact information, and Tweet at them directly through the app. Currently the user can search by state and access their local district level representatives throught their profile.

## Getting started

Welcome to Nightmare 
==========
NightmareJS on Heroku 
==========

## Setup
- `Clone Repo`
- $ `npm setup`
- $ `node index.js`

**Challenges:**
The challenges of making this MicroService started with accessing Twitter authentication. The process needs a review that takes over two weeks, this made it impossible to use the Twitter API to post a tweet so our work around was using nightmare js to log-in and post the tweet for us.

**Future Iterations**
- Instead of using a nightmare we would use the Twitter API so improve the usability of the MicroService.
